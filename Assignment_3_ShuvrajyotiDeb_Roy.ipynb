        "In this assignment, you are asked to calculate sharpe ratio first with your own code and then employing `PyPortfolioOpt` library using Apple, Amazon, 3M, and Exxon companies. Please see [this website](https://pyportfolioopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information about `PyPortfolioOpt`. The daily data covers the period of 2021-01-01 and 2022-01-01. To accomplish this task:\n",
